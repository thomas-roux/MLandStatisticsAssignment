2. Task 2: Calculate a chi-square statistic using `scipy.stats`
3. Task 3: Explain the difference between `STDDEV.S` and `STDDEV.P` in Excel, and show why `STDDEV.S` is a better estimator of population standard deviation when working with a sample
4. Task 4: Apply `k`-means clustering to Fisher's Iris dataset
