    "## Task 3\n",
    "The third task relates to one measure of dispersion around the mean, namely standard deviation. The task is to examine the difference between `STDDEV.S` and `STDDEV.P` in Excel, and then use `numpy` to explain why `STDDEV.S` is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample."

    "### What is a standard deviation?\n",
    "The standard deviation (SD) gives a measure of dispersement or spread of one's data around the mean [11]. A small SD indicates that the data is gathered close to the mean (small spread), while a large SD indicates that data is spread out quite widely around the mean [12]. The below image compares two populations with the same mean of 0, but with a SD of 1 and 3 respectively. Notice how the plot with SD of 3 is more dispersed around the mean of 0."

    "Finally, the SD is used in calculating the confidence interval (CI). A CI represents a range in which some value that we are interested in determining can be found [14]. Oftentimes, a 95% CI interval is presented. As has been shown above, 2SD around a mean usually contain ~95% of all values in the sample or population (1.96SD is exactly 95%). It is this characteristic of the SD that is useful for determining a range in which a value can be found."

    "The equation for calculating the SD of a **population** is: \n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\mu)}{N}}$$ where $\\sigma$ represents the population SD, $x_i$ is each value in the population, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $N$ is the size of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SD represents the spread of values around the mean, or put another way, how far a value is from the mean. This 'distance' can be represented by the difference between the value and a mean, represented as $x - \\mu$, where $x$ is the value, and $\\mu$ is the mean of all the data points. The mean is simply calculated by adding all the values in the data set together, and dividing by the number of values present. In other words, $\\frac{\\Sigma{x_i}}{N}$, where $x_i$ are each value in the data set, and $N$ is the total number of observations in the data set.\n",

    "If we merely added the difference for each $x - \\mu$, we would get a result of zero, because a value can be smaller or larger than the mean. For example, in an array of `[3,4,5,6,7]`, the mean is `5`. The difference between each value and the mean ($x - \\mu$) in turn is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`, which when added together equals zero. To prevent this, the value for each difference is squared: $\\Sigma(x - \\mu)^2$. This gives a positive array for each data point: `[4, 1, 0, 1, 4]`. The sum of this is now 10. This value is divided by the number of observations in the population, $N$, before the square root is applied to arrive at the population SD, $$\\sigma$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More frequently, a sample of a population is examined. The equation for calculating the SD of a **sample** is: \n",
    "$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\overline x)}{n - 1}}$$ where $s$ represents the sample SD, $x_i$ is each value in the sample, $\\overline x$ is the sample mean, and $n$ is the sample size. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between these two equations is in the denominator: population SD makes use of the *whole* population size, while sample SD makes use of the sample size minus one. It is this difference that is conveyed in the different Excel functions: `STDDEV.P` is used to calculate the SD of a *whole* population (e.g. all children in a class of interest), while `STDDEV.S` is used to calculate the SD of a *sample* of the population (e.g. a handful of children from the class of interest) [15]. Because it is often difficult to measure a complete population (either because the population is too big to measure in it's entirety, or the true size of the population is difficult to define), a sample is used. In the next section, we will use `numpy` to look at why using the sample equation (denominator $n-1$) is a better estimator of the SD than the population equation (denominator $N$)."
