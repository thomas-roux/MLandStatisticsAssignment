    "## Discussion\n",
    "The Chi square statistic of 24.6 calculated by the `scipy.stats.ch2_contingency` method aligns with that in the Wikipedia article. When one compares the *expected* values in the above output to the *observed* values in the original table, it is evident that in some categories, there are large differences between these two values. This is reflected in the significant *p* value of 0.0004, reported as p < 0.05. \n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between a person's neighbourhood of residence based on their occupational class, and state that there is a statistically significant difference between the distribution of persons across each neighbourhood based on their occupational class.

    "The third task relates to one measure of dispersion around the mean, namely standard deviation. The task is to examine the difference between `STDDEV.S` and `STDDEV.P` in Excel, and then use `numpy` to explain why `STDDEV.S` is a better estimate for the standard deviation of a population when performed on a sample."

    "### What is a standard deviation?\n",
    "The standard deviation (SD) gives a measure of dispersement or spread of one's data around the mean [[11]](#refs). A small SD indicates that the data is gathered close to the mean (small spread), while a large SD indicates that data is spread out quite widely around the mean [[12]](#refs). The below image compares two populations with the same mean of 0, but with a SD of 1 and 3 respectively. Notice how the plot with SD of 3 is more dispersed around the mean of 0."

    "Finally, the SD is used in calculating the confidence interval (CI). A CI represents a range in which some value that we are interested in determining can be found [[14]](#refs). Oftentimes, a 95% CI interval is presented. As has been shown above, 2SD around a mean usually contain ~95% of all values in the sample or population (1.96SD is exactly 95%).

    "The equation for calculating the SD of a **population** is: \n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x_i - \\mu)}{N}}$$ where $\\sigma$ represents the population SD, $x_i$ is each value in the population, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $N$ is the size of the population. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SD represents the spread of values around the mean, or put another way, how far a value is from the mean. This 'distance' can be represented by the difference between the value and a mean, represented as $x - \\mu$, where $x$ is the value, and $\\mu$ is the mean of all the data points. The mean is simply calculated by adding all the values in the data set together, and dividing by the number of values present. In other words, $\\frac{\\Sigma{x_i}}{N}$, where $x_i$ are each value in the data set, and $N$ is the total number of observations in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we merely added the difference for each $x - \\mu$, we would get a result of zero, because a value can be smaller or larger than the mean. For example, in an array of `[3,4,5,6,7]`, the mean is `5`. The difference between each value and the mean ($x - \\mu$) in turn is `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`, which when added together equals zero. To prevent this, the value for each difference is squared: $\\Sigma(x - \\mu)^2$. This gives a positive array for each data point: `[4, 1, 0, 1, 4]`. The sum of this is now 10. This value is divided by the number of observations in the population, $N$, before the square root is applied to arrive at the population SD, $\\sigma$.\n",

Because it is often difficult to measure a complete population (either because the population is too big to measure in it's entirety, or the true size of the population is difficult to define), a sample is used. In the next section, we will use `numpy` to look at why using the sample equation (denominator $n-1$) is a better estimator of the SD than the population equation (denominator $N$)."

    "K-means clustering is a method of unsupervised machine learning that groups together similar points in a dataset by identifying clusters of data objects in a dataset [[16]](#refs). This is achieved by first telling the algorithm how many clusters (k) the data should be seperated into. The algorithm then selects k number of random points in the dataset as the centre of the starting clusters. These centres are referred to as the centroid. Each datapoint is then assigned to the nearest centroid. The algorithm then calculates the mean of all the datapoints, and repositions the centroid to this calculated value. After the new centroid is calculated, all the datapoints are again reassigned to the new nearest centroid and hence, new cluster. The process repeats until no datapoints change to new clusters, i.e. the centroid does not change [[17]](#refs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Becuase the initial starting centroids are chosen at random, k-means will provide different results each time [[16]](#refs). For this reason, the algorithm is usually run several times, with cluster assignments leading to the lowest sum of the squared error (SSE: the sum of the squared Euclidean distance of each point to its closest centroid) been selected as the final result [[17]](#refs)."

There are two ways of determining an appropriate cluster size [[17]](#refs). Here we'll look at one, the **elbow method**.\n",

    "#### The elbow method\n",
    "The elbow method runs through repeated k-means calculations with increasing number of k, recording the SSE for each iteration. The k is plotted against the SEE for each iteration. Because the 'best' cluster distribution is usually that with the smallest SSE, the the number k with the smallest SSE would be preferred. However, there is a trade-off between k and SSE - the smaller the cluster, the less 'meaningful' the cluster becomes. So a 'sweet spot' is usually sought, right where the SSE curve starts to bend like an elbow. Hence, the elbow method. \n",
